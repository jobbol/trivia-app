**Trivia app** is a React web app built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) that asks the user multiple choice and true false questions.  It's written on top of the [OpenTrivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).

### Setup
1. Download the project repository, and extract to directory.
2. Open a terminal and move to the project directory.
3. Run `npm i` to install dependencies.

### Usage
After the app is setup, you can run:
* `npm run dev` for a live preview.  Which opens a web server to the app and automatically rebuilds the app on any changes.
* `npm run build` to compile the app to basic HTML, CSS, and JS.
